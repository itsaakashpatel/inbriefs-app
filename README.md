Welcome to Inbriefs, the ultimate news app that delivers concise news excerpts in just 100 words. Stay updated on the go without the hassle of reading lengthy articles.

## Why did I build the app?

In short, Inbriefs was a product of my own need and frustration. As a busy individual, I constantly found it difficult to keep up with the world news amidst my hectic schedule. 

Reading through entire articles was not an option and I felt that current news apps did not provide a solution to my problem. With this in mind, I decided to create Inbriefs. Its purpose is to cut through the noise, condensing news articles into brief, 100-word summaries, making it possible for people like me to stay informed without having to invest a lot of time.
